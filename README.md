Penguins and UKM Dataset Machine Learning & Visualization

This repository contains machine learning experiments, data visualization, and neural network modeling using Python, including decision tree visualization (dtreeviz), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), and a small TensorFlow example. It covers two datasets: the penguins dataset (from Seaborn) and the UCI "User Knowledge Modeling" (UKM) dataset.
